# Adapter Pattern

## Overview
Demonstration of the Adapter design pattern, which allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

## Design Pattern: Adapter
The Adapter pattern enables objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It is particularly useful when integrating new functionality with legacy code or when you need to work with existing systems that use different interfaces.

## Structure
This use case consists of three main components:

1. Target Interface (`NewLogger`)
   - Defines the interface expected by the client
   - Provides the methods that the client will use

2. Adaptee Class (`OldLogger`)
   - Contains the existing interface that needs adapting
   - Provides the original logging method

3. Adapter Class (`LoggerAdapter`)
   - Implements the target interface
   - Converts calls from the target interface to the methods of the adaptee class

4. Application Class (`Main`)
   - Demonstrates the usage of the Adapter pattern
   - Shows how the adapter allows the client to use the old logging system through the new interface

## How It Works
1. The Target Interface defines the methods expected by the client.
2. The Adaptee Class contains the existing method(s) that need adaptation.
3. The Adapter Class implements the Target Interface and translates calls to the Adapteeâ€™s methods.
4. The Application Class demonstrates how the Adapter seamlessly integrates the Adaptee with the Target interface, allowing the client to use the old functionality without modification.

## Key Features
- Interface Conversion: Transforms one interface into another that a client expects.
- Decoupling: Allows systems to work together without modifying existing code.
- Flexibility: Enables integration of new functionality with legacy systems.

## Use Case
This pattern is useful in scenarios where:
- You need to integrate new systems with legacy code.
- You want to adapt existing classes to a new interface without changing their implementation.
- You need to work with multiple interfaces but want to provide a unified interface to the client.

## Benefits
- Decouples Code: Allows existing systems to work together without changing their code.
- Improves Flexibility: Facilitates integration of new functionalities with legacy systems.
- Enhances Maintainability: Reduces the need to modify existing code, making the system easier to maintain.
