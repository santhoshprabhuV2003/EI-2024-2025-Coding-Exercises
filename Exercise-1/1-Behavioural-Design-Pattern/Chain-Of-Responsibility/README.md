# Customer Support Chain of Responsibility

## Overview
Demonstration of the Chain of Responsibility design pattern using a customer support system example. It shows how different levels of support can handle various types of customer issues based on their complexity.

## Design Pattern: Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a request to be passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Structure
This use case consists of the following components:

1. SupportHandler (Abstract Class)
   - Base class for all support handlers
   - Contains a reference to the next handler in the chain

2. Level1Support (Concrete Class)
   - Handles basic customer inquiries

3. Level2Support (Concrete Class)
   - Handles technical issues

4. Level3Support (Concrete Class)
   - Handles issues requiring manager intervention

5. CustomerSupport (Main Class)
   - Sets up the chain of responsibility
   - Demonstrates the usage of the pattern

## How It Works
1. A chain of support handlers is created: Level 1 -> Level 2 -> Level 3
2. Customer requests are passed to the first handler (Level 1)
3. Each handler checks if it can process the request:
   - If yes, it handles the request
   - If no, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain
4. If no handler can process the request, an appropriate message is displayed

## Benefits
- Decouples the sender of a request from its receivers
- Allows adding or removing responsibilities dynamically
- Promotes the single responsibility principle

## Use Case
This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where:
- Multiple objects may handle a request, and the handler isn't known a priori
- You want to issue a request to one of several objects without specifying the receiver explicitly
